    <p align="justify">JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.</p>
    <p>Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

    <h3><strong style="background-color: aqua;">How to Link JavaScript File in HTML?</strong></h3>
    <p>JavaScript can be added to HTML file in two ways:
        <br>
        <strong>Internal JS:</strong>We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the <u>script</u> tag. The <u>script</u> tag can either be placed inside the <u>head</u> or the <u>head</u> tag according to the requirement.
        <br>
        <strong>External JS:</strong> We can write JavaScript code in another files having an extension.js and then link this file inside the <u>head</u> tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</p>
