    <h2><b style="background-color: lawngreen;">What is Computer Science?</b></h2>
    <p align="justify">Computing is part of everything we do. Computing drives innovation in engineering, business, entertainment, education, and the sciences—and it provides solutions to complex, challenging problems of all kinds.
        <br>
        Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It is a broad field which includes everything from the algorithms that make up software to how software interacts with hardware to how well software is developed and designed. Computer scientists use various mathematical algorithms, coding procedures, and their expert programming skills to study computer processes and develop new software and systems.</p>
        <h2><b style="background-color: lawngreen;">How is Computer Science Different from IT?</b></h2>
        <center><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/693859/pexels-photo-693859.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" width="40%"><img src="https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/03/14/92/75/1000_F_314927575_yqFMAuXFTNC6gBflR2njRZ4bQb8dAb7y.jpg" width="40%"></center>
        <p><b>Computer science</b> focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems. It involves working with mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms, and computational theory. Computer scientists define the computational principles that are the basis of all software.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Information technology (IT)</b> focuses on the development, implementation, support, and management of computers and information systems. IT involves working both with hardware (CPUs, RAM, hard disks) and software (operating systems, web browsers, mobile applications). IT professionals make sure that computers, networks, and systems work well for all users.
